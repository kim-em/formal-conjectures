"""Map one Formal Conjectures declaration to a LeanEval module and manifest.

This is the Formal Conjectures side of the ownership split in
`leanprover/lean-eval#536`, and it is the part this repository owns
permanently. It resolves a declaration against an exact Formal Conjectures
commit, asks Lean what the elaborated environment knows about it, copies the
declarations it depends on, types each `answer(sorry)` slot, and records where
all of that came from.

What it produces is the pair defined in `comparator/adapter/leaneval_interface.py`: one
marked-up Mathlib-only Lean module, and one manifest carrying the FC source
commit and declaration id. Turning that pair into a Challenge / Solution /
Submission workspace is the pinned `leanprover/lean-eval-generator` binary's
job, not this module's; `leaneval_interface.build_request` is where the pair
becomes that binary's input.

Nothing here writes a workspace file, names a workspace layout, or decides
which generated module imports which. If a change to this file would do one of
those, it belongs on the other side of the seam.

Two source-boundary facts may live in `comparator/problems/<id>.toml`, one
file per problem: which file is meant when two declare the same name, and an
explicit source-only proof dependency when Lean's opaque-value erasure makes
that dependency unrecoverable from the compiled environment.
